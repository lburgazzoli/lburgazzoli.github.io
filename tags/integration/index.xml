What we will go through in this post is:
Apache Camel alike routing engine written in GoLang Embedded WebAssembly engine for extensible and safe message routing and transformation Actors Model OCI Artifacts Notes: the result of this work is by no mean expected to land in the official Apache Camel project or in any Red Hat Integration product Background To get started, let’s have a basic understanding of the components/technologies we are going to mention in this post:</description></item><item><title>Apache Kafka Connect meets Wasm - Part 1</title><link>https://lburgazzoli.github.io/posts/2024-02-01_apache_kafka_connect_meets_wasm_part_1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lburgazzoli.github.io/posts/2024-02-01_apache_kafka_connect_meets_wasm_part_1/</guid><description>I recently wrote a blog post about adding support for Wasm in Apache Camel with the goal to support WebAssembly as a means to provide custom processing and transformation logic within Apache Camel.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to experiment a little bit about doing the same but for Apache Kafka Connect.
