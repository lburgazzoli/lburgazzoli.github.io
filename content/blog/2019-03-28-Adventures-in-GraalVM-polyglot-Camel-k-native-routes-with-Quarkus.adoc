The last blog i wrotefootnote:[https://lburgazzoli.github.io/2018/09/04/Adventures-in-GraalVM-polyglot-Camel-routes-with-native-image.html] was about running integration code written in JavaScript from a Camel application compiled as native executable using SubstrateVM (part of the GraalVM project).

== Has something happen since then ?

I would say yes:

- https://github.com/apache/camel-k[Camel K]
- https://quarkus.io[Quarkus]
- Camel 3 development has finally started

As I'm involved in all the projects above, let see how they can play togheter to deliver a truly amazing cloud native experience.

CAUTION: this post is based on code not yet merged in the upstream repository and subject to change

== Bring some Quarkus to Camel K

Quarkus provides some initial supportfootnote:[https://quarkus.io/extensions/#integration] for Camel through dedicated extensions that:

- perform most of the steps needed to initialize a CamelContext instance at build time so as example, components, languages and data-formats are discovered and loaded into the registry when the build runs so Camel does not need to spend any time resolving and instantiating the related classes at run time
- provided SubstrateVM "hacks" to let Camel based appication to compile against Graal/SubstrateVM.

Quarkus supports CDI which let us use CDI annotations to obtain a reference to a bean holding optimized Camel bits and to adapt quarked Camel lifecycle events to Camel K lifecycle: 

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CamelKApplication {
    @Inject
    CamelRuntime runtime;

	List<Listener> listeners = new ArrayList<>();

    public void initializing(@Observes InitializingEvent event) {
        listeners.forEach(l -> l.accept(Phase.ConfigureContext, this));
        listeners.forEach(l -> l.accept(Phase.ConfigureRoutes, this));
    }

    public void starting(@Observes StartingEvent event) {    	
        listeners.forEach(l -> l.accept(Phase.Starting, this));
    }

    public void started(@Observes StartedEvent event) {
    	listeners.forEach(l -> l.accept(Phase.Started, this));
    }

    public void stopping(@Observes StoppingEvent event) {
    	listeners.forEach(l -> l.accept(Phase.Stopping, this));
    }

    public void stopped(@Observes StoppedEvent event) {
        listeners.forEach(l -> l.accept(Phase.Stopped, this));
    }
}
----

As we want to be able to run our code as native binary we also need to create a Camel K extension for Quarkusfootnote:[https://quarkus.io/guides/extension-authors-guide] that can instruct it about what it is needed for Camel K to properly build and run with SubstrateVM.

The minimum requirement is to make the services Camel K relies on available when running in native mode:

[source,java]
----
public class CamelQuarkusProcessor {
    @BuildStep
    void processServices(
            BuildProducer<ServiceProviderBuildItem> serviceProvider,
            CombinedIndexBuildItem combinedIndexBuildItem) {

        IndexView view = combinedIndexBuildItem.getIndex(); // <1>
        String type = "org.apache.camel.k.Runtime$Listener";
        
        view.getAllKnownImplementors(DotName.createSimple(type)).forEach(i-> {
            serviceProvider.produce(
                new ServiceProviderBuildItem(
                    type, 
                    i.name().toString())
           );
        }); // <2>
    }
}
----
<1> Leverage https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex] for efficient metadata  indexing and lookup
<2> Instruct Quarkus about concrete service provider needed ar runtime

We also want to make our application polyglot so we can add support for JavaScript through Graal JSfootnote:[https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/jvm/] and to do that in a previous release of GrallVMfootnote:[https://lburgazzoli.github.io/2018/09/04/Adventures-in-GraalVM-polyglot-Camel-routes-with-native-image.html] I had to implment some proxy classes to support reflective access from JavaScript back to Java but as of GraalVM RC13footnote:[https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc13], this is not more needed and instead we only need to list the impacted classed among those that need to be accessed reflectively.

In Quarkus this can be done through a dedicate BuildProducer:

[source,java]
----
public class CamelQuarkusProcessor {
    @BuildStep
    void processReflectiveClasses(
            BuildProducer<ReflectiveClassBuildItem> reflectiveClass,
            CombinedIndexBuildItem combinedIndexBuildItem) {

        reflectiveClass.produce(
            new ReflectiveClassBuildItem(
            	true, 
                false,
                "org.apache.camel.builder.ExpressionClause",
                "org.apache.camel.model.FromDefinition",
                "org.apache.camel.model.ProcessDefinition",
                "org.apache.camel.model.ProcessorDefinition",
                "org.apache.camel.model.RouteDefinition",
                "org.apache.camel.model.ToDefinition",
                "org.apache.camel.model.language.ExpressionDefinition",
                "org.apache.camel.spi.ExchangeFormatter")
        );
}
----

=== Run it 

The first test we can do is ot run our application in JVM mode so let's write a simple JavaScript route:

[source,js]
----
from('timer:js?period=1s')
    .setBody()
        .simple('Hello Camel K from ${routeId}')
    .to('log:info?multiline=true')
----

An run it:

Finaly we can run it on kubernetes with Camel K

=== Final Notes

The Camel extension provided by Quarkus are also able to optimize routes at build time but in Camel K we do not use such feature as we want to re-use pre built Integration Contexts (including native ones) as much as possible

As stated at the beginning this blog is based on code not yet merged in the related upstream projects but the result are already quite promising so stay tuned for more updates to come.
